# BigData_Project
This repository contains the final project contributing to the coursework for Big Data course at NYU in the Fall '20 term.

This project attempts to measure the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 in the stock market, specifically in fortune 500 companies. The goal is to understand how much COVID-19 spead up certain macroeconomic trends (such as increased digitization) and how this benefited certain companies and hurt others. 

We will also attempt to build a predictive model taking into account COVID-19.

Most of the infrastructure will be written using cloud computing which will allow us to use clusters for preprocessing the data as well as update the model automatically every certain time period to take things like model drift for example into account.
